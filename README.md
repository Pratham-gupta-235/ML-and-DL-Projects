## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratham-gupta-235/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Projects
   ```
2. **Navigate to a project folder and open the Jupyter notebook:**
   - For example, open `Credit Risk Modelling - Loan Classification.ipynb` in the relevant folder.

3. **Install required libraries:**
   Each project lists its dependencies in the README. Common libraries include:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - xgboost
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - streamlit (for web apps)

   Install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a `requirements.txt` is not present, install the libraries individually as specified in each project's README.)*
