# ML-and-DL-Projects

Welcome to the **ML-and-DL-Projects** repository! üöÄ

This repository is a collection of various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects, experiments, and notebooks. Here, you'll find implementations of popular algorithms, end-to-end solutions, and hands-on explorations of data science topics. Whether you're a beginner exploring ML/DL or an enthusiast looking to build upon existing projects, there's something for everyone.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- Each subfolder in this repository represents a separate project.
- Projects may include Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), Python scripts (`.py`), datasets, model files, and README files with their own instructions or explanations.
- Example projects you might find here:
  - Classification and regression examples
  - Image processing and computer vision
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, etc.)
  - Data visualization and preprocessing
  - Transfer learning and model fine-tuning

## üìù How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratham-gupta-235/ML-and-DL-Projects.git
   cd ML-and-DL-Projects
   ```

2. **Explore individual project folders:**  
   Each project will contain its own set of files and, where needed, a README with instructions on running the code.

3. **Run notebooks or scripts:**  
   Most projects use Jupyter Notebooks. You can run them using Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab.

## üì¶ Requirements

Requirements may vary between projects. Generally, the following packages are commonly used:

- Python 3.7+
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow or pytorch
- keras
- jupyter

Check individual project folders for their specific requirements.
