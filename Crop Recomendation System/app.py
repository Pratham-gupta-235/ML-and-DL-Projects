    ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!  
    I'm **Pratham Gupta**, and I'm thrilled to share my latest **Machine Learning** project: the **Crop Recommendation System**.  
    This system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to provide personalized crop suggestions based on soil and climate conditions.  

    ### Curious About the Code?  
    The full implementation is available on my GitHub, complete with documentation to help you dive right in.  
    ðŸ‘‰ [Visit My GitHub](https://github.com/Code1235/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Crop%20Recomendation%20System)  

    Thanks for stopping by, and happy exploring!

    **Features used for prediction:**
    - Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen content in soil
    - Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus content in soil
    - Potassium (K): Potassium content in soil
    - Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius
    - Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage
